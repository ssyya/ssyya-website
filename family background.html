  <h1>Family Background</h1>
  <img src="image/family.jpg" alt="raya" style="width:500px;height:380px">
  <p>I am from a family of 8 and I have a total of 6 siblings including myself and I am the 5th child out of the them. Living my whole life with 2 older sisters, 2 older brothers and 1 younger brother until I continued my studies at 18, I had a great bond with them. We fought a lot but we cares deeply towards one another.</p>

    <h1>Parents</h1>
    <img src="image/mak ayah.jpg" alt="parents" style="width:500px;height:380px">
    </center>
    <p>My father is Che Abdullah Bin Mohd Ali. He was born on the 20th May 1960 at Selangor in a family of 10. He is the 6th child out of 8. Although he wasn't the youngest child, but his older siblings still calls him "Adik" until now. He was raised in a religous family as his late father which is my grandfather is an Imam at a surau in his neighbourhood and people usually calls him "Lebai Ali" or "Imam Ali". My grandmother on the other hand, is a housewive and also sells kuih and Nasi Lemak around the area. Now, my father is a 63 years old retired air force TUDM. He has retired for about 25 years but after he retired, he still worked for TUDM but under a private agency as a technician in Subang Airport until he was 60 years old. After SPM, he directly went to military air force and didn't continue for further studies but he proves that he made it even without a diploma or a degree holder. Hence, why I think he is an inspiration to our family. He made us believe that success isn't just by certificates but through your hardwork and passion as well. His characteristics is that he is a strict but also a loving parent. As an army, I believe that is why he was strict towards his children before. Now, that we are older, he is less strict and let us decide everything in our life. I truly believe that now he is my lifetime advisor and I am really grateful for him.</p>
    <p>My mother is Mahizan Binti Abdul Ghani. She is a 59 years old full time housewive and has never work before except that she used to sell Nasi Dagang back when I was in primary school. Now, she help my sister with her business which is selling desserts and drinks on a food truck. She was born on the 4th January 1964 in Selangor in a family of 7. She is the 3rd child out of 5. Her late father used to be a medical military man and when he retired, he open a small business as a chicken breeder and soon after, he open a grocery store. Her  late mother is a full time housewive and helps with the business as well. My mother grew up helping my late grandfather's business even after she was married with my father. Like my father, she only take up until SPM. At 23, she married my father through a family connection. They both lived in the same area. Hence, why their late parents know each other and match them up. Her characteristics is that she is my father's backbone, a very strong women, and the one in charge of taking care of the family. She never showed her weaknesses and always stand strong with her principles. I believe that she is quite fierce and strict in raising her children. But thanks to that, all of her children become a good human being and not distorted by their social environment.
